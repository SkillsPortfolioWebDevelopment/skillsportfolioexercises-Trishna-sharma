        Dre moves from the mid-west to China for his mom's new job. The adjustment is somewhat difficult, with the new culture and all. <br />Dre starts at his new school and starts to like a violinist Mei Ying. They instantly become friends.<br /> Meanwhile, being the new guy in school, Dre also develops enemies, a bully named Cheng, who is good at martial <br /> arts. After a fight that leads back to Dre's apartment complex, Dre is defended by the apartment handyman Mr. Han. Han <br />takes Dre to patch things up with Cheng at a martial arts class, but Cheng's master asks for a battle instead. Han intercedes <br />and requests that a battle take place in a coming tournament instead. Cheng's teacher agrees.<br /><br /> Dre and Han practice daily, and Han takes Dre on an out of town trip to the mountains for inspiring lessons.<br /> Han instills patience and fluid movements in Dre, versus opting for brute force. Dre becomes the astute student,<br /> all while learning a bit about Eastern culture. The tournament is nearing, and Mei Ying has a competition<br /> as well and she <br />invites Dre to her recital. Dre is frowned upon by Mei Ying's parents at first but when they see that he has noble intentions for her, they <br />let them continue their friendship. At the tournament, Dre slowly moves from one level to the next, to the semi-finals. He gets <br />injured in the leg and gets beaten in that round. However, he is determined to finish the contest so after a therapy session<br /> with Han, he steps onto the mat, and faces Cheng. Cheng is ruthless and strong, Dre much more cunning. Cheng re-injures<br /> Dre's leg, but Dre in a last effort to win, pulls out a move<br /> he learned from the mountain field trip with Han, and beats Cheng.<br />
